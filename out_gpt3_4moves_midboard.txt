What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to f6?
1. The knight can move two squares horizontally or vertically and then one square perpendicular to that direction. This means that it can move from d4 to either f5 or b5 in just one move.
2. From f5 or b5, the knight can then move to either e7 or d6 in just one move.
3. Finally, from e7 or d6, the knight can move to f6 in just one move.

Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves for the knight to move from d4 to f6 is three moves.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to f6?
First, the knight can move from d4 to e6 or f5 in one move. From there, the knight can move to either f6 or d6 in one move. Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves is two: d4 to f5 to f6 or d4 to e6 to d6 to f6.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to f6?
1. The knight can move to e6 or f5 in the first move.
2. From e6, the knight can move to f4 or g5.
3. From f5, the knight can move to d6 or g7.
4. From f4, the knight can move to d5 or e6.
5. From g5, the knight can move to e4 or h7.
6. From d6, the knight can move to f7 or b7.
7. From g7, the knight can move to f5 or h5.
8. From d5, the knight can move to f6 or c5.
9. From e4, the knight can move to f6 or d6.
10. From h7, the knight can move to f6 or g5.
11. From f7, the knight can move to e5 or h6.
12. From b7, the knight can move to c5 or a5.
13. From f5, the knight can move to e7 or g7.
14. From h5, the knight can move to g3 or f4.
15. From c5, the knight can move to d7 or b7.
16. From e7, the knight can move to f5 or g6.
17. From g3, the knight can move to f5 or h6.
18. From d7, the knight can move to e5 or c5.
19. From f4, the knight can move to g6 or h5.
20. From g6, the knight can move to f4 or h4.
21. From e5, the knight can move to f3 or d3.
22. From h6, the knight can move to g4 or f5.
23. From g4, the knight can move to f6 or h6.
24. From h4, the knight can move to g6 or f5.

Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves to reach f6 from d4 is 3. The knight can move from d4 to f5 in the first move, then to e7, and finally to f6.
