What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to e3? What about from e3 to c3
To move from a1 to e3, the knight can take the following path: 

1. a1 - c2 
2. c2 - d4 
3. d4 - e3 

Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves is 3. 

To move from e3 to c3, the knight can take the following path: 

1. e3 - d1 
2. d1 - b2 
3. b2 - c3 

Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves is again 3.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to e3? What about from e3 to c3
To move from a1 to e3, the knight can take the following path:

1. Move to b3
2. Move to d4
3. Move to e3

So the shortest possible number of moves is 3.

To move from e3 to c3, the knight can take the following path:

1. Move to d5
2. Move to b4
3. Move to c3

So the shortest possible number of moves is also 3.
----------------------------------------------------------------
What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to d4? What about from d4 to c3
To move a knight from a1 to d4, the shortest possible number of moves is 2. The knight can move from a1 to c2 (1st move), and then from c2 to d4 (2nd move).

To move a knight from d4 to c3, the shortest possible number of moves is also 2. The knight can move from d4 to b5 (1st move), and then from b5 to c3 (2nd move).
----------------------------------------------------------------
What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to d4? What about from d4 to c3
To move from a1 to d4, the knight can take the following path: 

1. a1 to b3 
2. b3 to c5 
3. c5 to d4 

Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves is 3. 

To move from d4 to c3, the knight can take the following path: 

1. d4 to b5 
2. b5 to c3 

Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves is 2.
----------------------------------------------------------------
What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to d4? What about from d4 to c3
From a1 to d4, the knight can move in the following sequence: a1 to b3 to c5 to d4. This takes a total of three moves.

From d4 to c3, the knight can move in the following sequence: d4 to b5 to c3. This also takes a total of three moves.
