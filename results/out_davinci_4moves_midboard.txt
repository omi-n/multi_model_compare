What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to f6?
 The knight can move two squares in one direction and then one square in a perpendicular direction. This means that the knight can move from d4 to f6 in two moves: d4-e6-f6.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to f6?
 The knight can move in an “L” shape, so the shortest possible number of moves would be three. 

The knight can move from d4 to c6 in one move, then from c6 to e5 in the second move, and finally from e5 to f6 in the third move.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to f6?
 The knight can move in an L-shape, two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally.

1. Move from d4 to e6
2. Move from e6 to g5
3. Move from g5 to f6

Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight can move from d4 to f6 is 3.
