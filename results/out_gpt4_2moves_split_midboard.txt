What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to h2? What about h2 to f6?
From d4 to h2, the shortest possible number of moves for a knight is 3. The moves would be d4-f3, f3-h4, and h4-h2.

From h2 to f6, the shortest possible number of moves for a knight is 2. The moves would be h2-g4, and g4-f6.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to h2? What about h2 to f6?
From d4 to h2:
1. Move from d4 to f5.
2. Move from f5 to h4.
3. Move from h4 to h2.
So, the shortest possible number of moves is 3.

From h2 to f6:
1. Move from h2 to g4.
2. Move from g4 to f6.
So, the shortest possible number of moves is 2.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to h2? What about h2 to f6?
First, we will solve for d4 to h2.

1. From d4, the knight can move to either c2, e2, b3, f3, b5, f5, c6, or e6.
2. From c2, the knight can move to a1, a3, b4, d4, e3, or e1. (2 moves so far)
3. From e2, the knight can move to c1, c3, d4, f4, g3, or g1. (2 moves so far)

Now we can see that from c2, the knight can reach h2 in two additional moves: c2 -> e3 -> g2 -> h2. So the total number of moves is 4 for d4 to h2.

Now let's solve for h2 to f6.

1. From h2, the knight can move to f1, f3, g4, or e3.
2. From f1, the knight can move to d2, h3, g4, or e2. (2 moves so far)
3. From f3, the knight can move to d2, d4, e5, g5, h4, or h2. (2 moves so far)
4. From g4, the knight can move to e3, e5, f2, h2, f6, or h6. (2 moves so far)

Now we can see that from g4, the knight can reach f6 in one additional move: g4 -> f6. So the total number of moves is 3 for h2 to f6.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to g5? What about g5 to f6?
For d4 to g5:
1. The knight moves from d4 to f3.
2. The knight moves from f3 to g5.
So, the shortest possible number of moves is 2.

For g5 to f6:
1. The knight moves from g5 to e4.
2. The knight moves from e4 to f6.
So, the shortest possible number of moves is 2.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to g5? What about g5 to f6?
For d4 to g5:
1. The knight moves from d4 to f5.
2. The knight moves from f5 to g3.
3. The knight moves from g3 to g5.

So, the shortest possible number of moves is 3.

For g5 to f6:
1. The knight moves from g5 to h3.
2. The knight moves from h3 to f4.
3. The knight moves from f4 to f6.

So, the shortest possible number of moves is 3.
----------------------------------------------------------------
What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to g5? What about g5 to f6?
First, let's look at the knight's move from d4 to g5.

1. d4 -> e6
2. e6 -> g5

So, the shortest possible number of moves from d4 to g5 is 2 moves.

Now, let's look at the knight's move from g5 to f6.

1. g5 -> e5
2. e5 -> f6

So, the shortest possible number of moves from g5 to f6 is 2 moves as well.
