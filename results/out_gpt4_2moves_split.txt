What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to e3? What about from e3 to c3
For a knight to move from a1 to e3, the shortest possible number of moves is 3. 
Here's the sequence: 
1. a1 to c2
2. c2 to d4
3. d4 to e3

For a knight to move from e3 to c3, the shortest possible number of moves is 2.
Here's the sequence:
1. e3 to d1
2. d1 to c3

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to e3? What about from e3 to c3
For a1 to e3:
1. Move the knight from a1 to c2.
2. Move the knight from c2 to e3.
So, the shortest possible number of moves from a1 to e3 is 2 moves.

For e3 to c3:
1. Move the knight from e3 to d1.
2. Move the knight from d1 to b2.
3. Move the knight from b2 to c3.
So, the shortest possible number of moves from e3 to c3 is 3 moves.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to e3? What about from e3 to c3
From a1 to e3: 
1. Move the knight from a1 to c2.
2. Move the knight from c2 to e3.
So, the shortest possible number of moves is 2.

From e3 to c3:
1. Move the knight from e3 to d1.
2. Move the knight from d1 to b2.
3. Move the knight from b2 to c3.
So, the shortest possible number of moves is 3.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to d4? What about from d4 to c3
From a1 to d4:
1. Move the knight from a1 to c2.
2. Move the knight from c2 to d4.
So, the shortest possible number of moves is 2.

From d4 to c3:
1. Move the knight from d4 to e2.
2. Move the knight from e2 to c3.
So, the shortest possible number of moves is 2.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to d4? What about from d4 to c3
From a1 to d4, the shortest possible number of moves is 3. The path can be: a1 -> c2 -> b4 -> d4.

From d4 to c3, the shortest possible number of moves is 2. The path can be: d4 -> e2 -> c3.
----------------------------------------------------------------
What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to d4? What about from d4 to c3
For a1 to d4:
1. From a1, the knight can move to either b3 or c2.
2. From b3, the knight can move to either a1, c1, d2, or a5.
3. From c2, the knight can move to either a1, a3, b4, d4, e1, or e3.

So, the knight can reach d4 in 3 moves (a1 -> c2 -> d4).

For d4 to c3:
1. From d4, the knight can move to either b3, b5, c2, c6, e2, e6, f3, or f5.
2. From b3, the knight can move to c1, c5, a4, a2, or d2.
3. From f3, the knight can move to d2, d4, e1, e5, g1, g5, h2, or h4.

So, the knight can reach c3 in 2 moves (d4 -> b3 -> c3).
