What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to f6?
First, the knight can move from d4 to either e6 or f5, which takes 1 move. Then, from either of these positions, the knight can move directly to f6 in the next move. So the shortest possible number of moves for a knight to move from d4 to f6 is 2 moves.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to f6?
In the first step, the knight can move to either c2, b3, b5, c6, e6, f5, f3, or e2. 

From these positions, let's see how many steps are required to reach f6:

- From c2, the knight can reach f6 in 2 moves (c2-e3-f6 or c2-a3-f6).
- From b3, the knight can reach f6 in 3 moves (b3-d2-f3-f6 or b3-d4-f5-f6).
- From b5, the knight can reach f6 in 3 moves (b5-d6-f5-f6 or b5-d4-f5-f6).
- From c6, the knight can reach f6 in 2 moves (c6-e5-f6 or c6-a5-f6).
- From e6, the knight can reach f6 in 2 moves (e6-c5-f6 or e6-g5-f6).
- From f5, the knight can reach f6 in 3 moves (f5-d6-f7-f6 or f5-d4-f5-f6).
- From f3, the knight can reach f6 in 3 moves (f3-d2-f1-f6 or f3-d4-f5-f6).
- From e2, the knight can reach f6 in 2 moves (e2-g3-f6 or e2-c3-f6).

The minimum number of moves required to reach f6 from any of these positions is 2. Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves for a knight to move from d4 to f6 on an empty chessboard is 1 + 2 = 3 moves.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to f6?
In the first move, the knight can move to either b5, b3, c2, e2, f3, or f5. From these positions, the knight can reach f6 in the following moves:

- From b5, it takes 2 more moves (b5-d6-f6).
- From b3, it takes 2 more moves (b3-d2-f6).
- From c2, it takes 3 more moves (c2-e3-d5-f6).
- From e2, it takes 3 more moves (e2-d4-d6-f6).
- From f3, it takes 2 more moves (f3-d4-f6).
- From f5, it takes 4 more moves (f5-d4-d6-f6).

So, the shortest possible number of moves is 2.
