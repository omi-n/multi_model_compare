What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to h2? What about h2 to f6?
To move from d4 to h2, we can take the following steps:

1. Move two squares up to f5.
2. Move one square right to g7.
3. Move two squares left and one square down to h5.
4. Move one square right and two squares down to f4.
5. Move two squares up to h3.
6. Move one square right to g1.
7. Move two squares down to h2.

Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves is 7.

To move from h2 to f6, we can take the following steps:

1. Move two squares up to g4.
2. Move one square left to f6.

Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves is 2.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to h2? What about h2 to f6?
To move from d4 to h2, the knight can make the following moves: 

1. d4 to e2 
2. e2 to g3 
3. g3 to h1 
4. h1 to f2 
5. f2 to h3 
6. h3 to g1 
7. g1 to h2 

Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves is 7.

To move from h2 to f6, the knight can make the following moves: 

1. h2 to g4 
2. g4 to f6 

Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves is 2.
----------------------------------------------------------------
What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to h2? What about h2 to f6?
To move from d4 to h2, the knight has to move two squares up and one square right, or one square up and two squares right. We can do this in just two moves:

1. Nd2 (moves one square up and two squares right)
2. Nf3 (moves two squares up)

To move from h2 to f6, the knight has to move two squares down and one square left, or one square down and two squares left. Again, we can do this in just two moves:

1. Ng1 (moves one square down and two squares left)
2. Nh3 (moves two squares up and one square left)

Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves for each scenario is 2 moves.
----------------------------------------------------------------
What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to g5? What about g5 to f6?
To move from d4 to g5, the shortest possible number of moves is 3. The knight can move to e6 (1st move), then to f4 (2nd move), and finally to g5 (3rd move).

To move from g5 to f6, the shortest possible number of moves is 1. The knight can move directly from g5 to f6 in one move.
----------------------------------------------------------------
What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to g5? What about g5 to f6?
To move from d4 to g5, the knight can take the following path: d4 → e6 → f4 → g5. This requires 3 moves.

To move from g5 to f6, the knight can take the following path: g5 → e4 → f6. This also requires 3 moves.

Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves for both scenarios is 3.
----------------------------------------------------------------
What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to g5? What about g5 to f6?
For the first question, the shortest possible number of moves is 2. The knight can move from d4 to either f5 or e6 on its first move, and then from there to g5 on its second move.

For the second question, the shortest possible number of moves is 1. The knight can move directly from g5 to f6 in one move.
