What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to c3?
In the first move, the knight can move to either b3 or c2. 
In the second move, from b3, it can move to a1, c1, d2, or d4. From c2, it can move to a1, a3, b4, or d4. 

As we can see, it takes a minimum of 2 moves for the knight to move from a1 to c3.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to c3?
A knight moves in an L-shape, either two squares in one direction and one square in the other direction, or one square in one direction and two squares in the other direction.

In this case, the knight is at a1 and wants to move to c3. The shortest path would be:

1. Move two squares to the right (to c1) and one square up (to c2).
2. Move one square to the left (to b2) and two squares up (to b4).
3. Move two squares to the left (to d4) and one square down (to c3).

So, the shortest possible number of moves for a knight to move from a1 to c3 is 3 moves.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to c3?
In the first move, the knight can either move to b3 or c2. If it moves to b3, it will take one more move to reach c3. If it moves to c2, it will again take one more move to reach c3. So, in both cases, the shortest possible number of moves is 2.
----------------------------------------------------------------
What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from b2 to d4?
In the first move, the knight can go to either a4, c4, or d1. From these positions:

1. If it goes to a4, in the second move, it can go to either b6 or c3. Neither of these positions is d4.
2. If it goes to c4, in the second move, it can go to either a5, a3, b2, d2, e5, or e3. One of these positions is d4.
3. If it goes to d1, in the second move, it can go to either b2, f2, or c4. Neither of these positions is d4.

So, the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight can move from b2 to d4 is 2 moves.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from b2 to d4?
From b2, a knight has two possible moves: to a4 or to c4.

1. If the knight moves to a4, its next possible moves are to b6, c2, or c6. None of these positions are d4, which means that moving to a4 will take more than 2 moves.
2. If the knight moves to c4, its next possible moves are to a3, a5, b2, d2, e3, or e5. Among these positions, e3 is the closest to d4.

So, the shortest possible number of moves would be:
1st move: b2 to c4
2nd move: c4 to e3
3rd move: e3 to d4

Thus, the shortest possible number of moves is 3.
