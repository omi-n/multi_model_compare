What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to h2? What about h2 to f6?
 

From d4 to h2:
1. Move the knight to e6
2. Move the knight to g3
3. Move the knight to h2

Total moves: 3

From h2 to f6:
1. Move the knight to g4
2. Move the knight to e5
3. Move the knight to f6

Total moves: 3

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to h2? What about h2 to f6?
 

The shortest possible number of moves for a knight to move from d4 to h2 is 3 moves. 

The knight needs to move to f3, then e5, and then finally g4, which will then bring it to h2. 

The shortest possible number of moves for a knight to move from h2 to f6 is also 3 moves. 

The knight needs to move to g4, then e5, and then finally f7, which will then bring it to f6.

From d4 to h2: The shortest possible number of moves for a knight on an empty chessboard to move from d4 to h2 is 3. The knight needs to move to f5, then g3, and then h2.

From h2 to f6: The shortest possible number of moves for a knight on an empty chessboard to move from h2 to f6 is 2. The knight needs to move to g4, and then f6.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to g5? What about g5 to f6?
 The knight can reach g5 from d4 in three moves: d4-f3-h4-g5. To get from g5 to f6, it takes two moves: g5-e6-f6. Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves required to move a knight from d4 to g5, and then from g5 to f6 is five moves.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to g5? What about g5 to f6?


D4 to G5: The knight can move from d4 to f3 in one move, then from f3 to g5 in two moves (f3-d4-g5). So the shortest possible number of moves is three.

G5 to F6: The knight can move from g5 to h3 in one move, then from h3 to f4 in two moves (h3-g5-f4), then from f4 to f6 in one move. So the shortest possible number of moves is four.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to g5? What about g5 to f6?


D4 to G5: The shortest possible number of moves is 2. The knight can move to either f6 or e3 and then to g5.

G5 to F6: The shortest possible number of moves is also 2. The knight can move to either h3 or g4 and then to f6.
