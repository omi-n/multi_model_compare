What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to d1?
1. The knight can move two squares in one direction (either vertically or horizontally) and then one square in the other direction. Therefore, the knight can move from a1 to b3 in one move.
2. From b3, the knight can move one square vertically up to c4 in one move.
3. From c4, the knight can move one square horizontally right to d4 in one move.
4. Finally, from d4, the knight can move one square vertically down to d1 in one move.

Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to d1 is 4.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to d1?
1. The knight can move from a1 to c2 (1 move).
2. From c2, the knight can move to either d4 or b4 (2 moves).
3. From d4 or b4, the knight can move to d3 (3 moves).
4. Finally, from d3, the knight can move to d1 (4 moves).

Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves is 4.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to d1?
First, the knight can move from a1 to c2. 
Then, the knight can move from c2 to d4. 
Finally, the knight can move from d4 to d2 and then to d1. 

Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves is 4.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to d5?
1. The knight can move two squares vertically and one square horizontally or two squares horizontally and one square vertically.
2. Starting from a1, the knight can move to b3 or c2 with one move.
3. From b3, the knight can move to d4 with one move.
4. From c2, the knight can move to d4 with one move.
5. Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves for a knight to move from a1 to d5 is two moves: a1 to b3 or c2, and then b3 or c2 to d4. Finally, the knight can move from d4 to d5 with one move.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to d5?
1. The knight can move to b3 or c2.
2. From b3, the knight can move to d4.
3. From c2, the knight can move to d4.
Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves is 2. The knight moves from a1 to b3 or c2, and then from there to d4 and finally to d5.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to d5?
1. The knight can move from a1 to b3 in one move.
2. From b3, the knight can move to d4 in two moves.
3. Finally, the knight can move to d5 in one more move.

Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from a1 to d5 is 4 moves.
