What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to g4?
In the first move, the knight can move to either b5, b3, c6, c2, e6, e2, f5, or f3. Notice that the only squares that are a knight's move away from g4 are e3, e5, f2, and f6. So, let's consider the squares the knight can move to in the second move:

1. If the knight moves to b5 or b3, it will take at least two more moves to reach any of the target squares (e3, e5, f2, or f6). This would result in a minimum of 4 moves.
2. If the knight moves to c6 or c2, it will take at least one more move to reach any of the target squares. This would result in a minimum of 3 moves.
3. If the knight moves to e6 or e2, it can directly reach g4 in the next move. This would result in a minimum of 2 moves.
4. If the knight moves to f5 or f3, it will take at least one more move to reach any of the target squares. This would result in a minimum of 3 moves.

Based on this analysis, the shortest possible number of moves for the knight to move from d4 to g4 is 2 moves.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to g4?
1. First, the knight on d4 can move to either f5, f3, e6, e2, c6, c2, b5, or b3.
2. From f5, the knight can move to h6, h4, g7, or d3.
3. From f3, the knight can move to h4, h2, g1, or d1.
4. From e6, the knight can move to g5, g7, c7, c5, f8, or f4.
5. From e2, the knight can move to g1, g3, c3, c1, f4, or f8.
6. From c6, the knight can move to e5, e7, a7, a5, d8, or d4.
7. From c2, the knight can move to e1, e3, a3, a1, d4, or d8.
8. From b5, the knight can move to a7, a3, d6, d4, or c8.
9. From b3, the knight can move to a5, a1, d2, d4, or c8.

We can see that from f3, the knight can move directly to g4 in the 3rd step. So the shortest possible number of moves is 2.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to g4?
In the first move, the knight can move to either of the following squares: b3, b5, c2, c6, e2, e6, f3, or f5. 

In the second move, from any of these positions, let's find a square that brings the knight closer to g4:

- From b3, the knight can move to a1, a5, c1, c5, or d2.
- From b5, the knight can move to a3, a7, c3, c7, or d6.
- From c2, the knight can move to a1, a3, b4, d4, or e1.
- From c6, the knight can move to a5, a7, b4, d4, or e7.
- From e2, the knight can move to c1, c3, d4, f1, or g3.
- From e6, the knight can move to c5, c7, d4, f5, or g7.
- From f3, the knight can move to d2, d4, e1, e5, or g1.
- From f5, the knight can move to d4, d6, e3, e7, or g3.

Notice that from these new positions, the knight can reach g4 in just one more move from d2, d6, or e2. For example:

- From d2, the knight can move to b1, b3, c4, e4, or f1.
- From d6, the knight can move to b5, b7, c4, e4, or f7.
- From e2, the knight can move to c1, c3, d4, f1, or g4.

As we can see, the shortest possible number of moves for a knight to move from d4 to g4 is 3 moves.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to h7?
First, a knight moves in an L-shape, which means it moves two squares in one direction and one square in another direction. 

1. From d4, the knight can go to either b5, b3, c6, e6, f5, f3, c2, or e2.
2. From b5 or f3, the knight can go to a3, a7, d7, or d1.
3. From c6, e6, or f5, the knight can go to g7.

So, the shortest possible number of moves for a knight to move from d4 to h7 is 3 moves.
----------------------------------------------------------------
What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to h7?
From d4, the knight can move to either of these squares in 1 move: c2, e2, b3, f3, b5, f5, c6, and e6.

Now let's see which of these squares can reach h7 in the shortest number of moves.

1. From c2, the knight can reach h7 in 3 moves (c2-e3-g4-h6-h7 or c2-a3-c4-e5-h7).
2. From e2, the knight can reach h7 in 3 moves (e2-g3-h5-g7-h7 or e2-c3-e4-g5-h7).
3. From b3, the knight can reach h7 in 2 moves (b3-d2-f3-h7).
4. From f3, the knight can reach h7 in 2 moves (f3-h4-g6-h7 or f3-d2-b1-h7).
5. From b5, the knight can reach h7 in 3 moves (b5-d6-f7-h7 or b5-d4-f5-h7).
6. From f5, the knight can reach h7 in 3 moves (f5-h6-g8-h7 or f5-d6-b7-h7).
7. From c6, the knight can reach h7 in 3 moves (c6-e7-g6-h7 or c6-a5-c4-e5-h7).
8. From e6, the knight can reach h7 in 3 moves (e6-g5-h3-g1-h7 or e6-c7-e8-g7-h7).

So the shortest possible number of moves is 1 (from d4) + 2 (from b3 or f3) = 3 moves.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to h7?
From d4, the knight can move to the following squares in one move: b3, b5, c2, c6, e2, e6, f3, and f5.

Now, let's see where the knight can go in two moves:
- From b3: a1, a5, c1, c5, d2, d6
- From b5: a3, a7, c3, c7, d4, d8
- From c2: a1, a3, b4, b6, d1, d3, e1, e3
- From c6: a5, a7, b4, b8, d5, d7, e5, e7
- From e2: c1, c3, d1, d3, f1, f3, g4, g6
- From e6: c5, c7, d4, d8, f5, f7, g4, g8
- From f3: d2, d4, e1, e5, g1, g5, h2, h6
- From f5: d4, d6, e3, e7, g3, g7, h4, h8

None of these squares are h7, so the knight cannot reach h7 in two moves. Now let's see where the knight can go in three moves:

- From a1: b3, c2, c6
- From a5: b3, b7, c4, c6
- From c1: a2, a6, b3, b5, d3, d5, e2, e6
- From c5: a4, a6, b3, b7, d4, d6, e4, e8
- From d2: b1, b3, c4, c6, e4, e6, f1, f3
- From d6: b5, b7, c4, c8, e4, e8, f5, f7
- From a3: b1, b5, c2, c6
- From a7: b5, c6, c8
- From c3: a2, a6, b1, b5, d1, d5, e2,
