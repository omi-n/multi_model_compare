What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to g4?
First, the knight can move to either f5 or e6 (2 possible moves). From there, it can move to either g4 or d5 (2 possible moves). Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves is 2. 

The knight can move from d4 to f5, and then from f5 to g4. Alternatively, it can move from d4 to e6, and then from e6 to g4. Both of these options take only 2 moves.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to g4?
First, the knight can move from d4 to f5 or e6, since those are the only two squares that are one move away and not obstructed by any other pieces. 

From there, the knight can make a direct move to g4, which is only one move away. 

Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves for the knight to move from d4 to g4 is two moves: d4 to f5 (or e6), and then f5 (or e6) to g4.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to g4?
1. The knight can move to either f5 or e6 in one move.
2. From f5, the knight can move to g4 in one move.
3. From e6, the knight can move to g5 in two moves (e6-g5-f7-h6-g4).
Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves is 2, achieved by moving the knight from d4 to f5 and then to g4.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to h7?
First, the knight can move one space up or down to reach either e5 or c5. From there, it can move two spaces diagonally to reach either g6 or a6. Finally, it can move two spaces horizontally to reach h7. Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves is three.

What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to h7?
First, the knight can move to e6 or f5 in two moves. 
From there, it can move to g7 in one move. 
Finally, it can move to h7 in one move. 
Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves is four.
----------------------------------------------------------------
What is the shortest possible number of moves in which a knight on an empty chessboard can move from d4 to h7?
1. The knight can move to f5 or e6.
2. From f5, the knight can move to h6 or g7.
3. From e6, the knight can move to g7 or f8.
4. From h6, the knight can move to f7 or g8.
5. From f7, the knight can move to h8, reaching h7 in 5 moves.

Therefore, the shortest possible number of moves for a knight on an empty chessboard to move from d4 to h7 is 5.
